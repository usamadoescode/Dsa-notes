# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my personal DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning repository!  
This repo is my journey of understanding core DSA concepts, solving problems, and writing clean, optimized code.

---

## 📌 What is DSA?

**DSA** stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

- **Data Structures** are ways to organize and store data (like arrays, lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps).
- **Algorithms** are step-by-step methods to solve problems (like searching, sorting, traversals).

Together, DSA helps us write **faster, cleaner, and more efficient code** 💻✨

## ⚡ Why Learn DSA?

✅ To solve problems logically  
✅ To ace technical interviews (DSA is a must!)  
✅ To write better code in real-life projects  
✅ To understand what’s happening under the hood

## 🧠 Big O Notation — What Is It?

**Big O** is used to describe the **time and space complexity** of an algorithm — in **worst-case** or **approximate terms**.

It tells us how **fast** (or slow) an algorithm is as the **input size increases**.

---

### 🔢 Common Time Complexities:

| Notation | Name           | Meaning                            |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| O(1)     | Constant Time  | Fast! Time doesn't grow with input |
| O(n)     | Linear Time    | Time grows with input size         |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic    | Fast even with big data            |
| O(n²)    | Quadratic      | Slow for large inputs              |

---

### 📦 Examples:

- **O(1)** → Accessing an item in a list or dict  
  → `arr[0]` or `my_dict['key']`
  
- **O(n)** → Looping over all items  
  → `for item in arr: print(item)`
